               Millennium Academy is where I spent my entire elementary and highschool lives. I was a good ranking student when I was in elementary school. I had many friends both at school and in my village. Playing 
               football was a routine activity then. After lunch, all boys gathered to play football usually with a small ball made of sock and residual plastics.
               I remember how our clothes got dirty because the footballl pitch was very dusty. School trips and birthdays are also the best memeories of elementary school.
               Secondary and highschools were however differrent. Playing was reduced, and sitting and chatting with friends and classmates was common. The studies got a bit more 
               difficult, so I had to devote more time on studying and reading. But this doesn't mean that I always studied. I also have unforgettable memeories 
               with my classmates. Football matches between classes, pool, and swimming are some of my best highschool memeories. The month before the grade 12 
               national exam put me under stress and it is one of my worst memories in my higschool life.
