               I now learn in the  <a href="http://www.aau.edu.et/eiabc/">Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction, and City Development (EiABC)</a> , which is one 
               of the campuses of Addis Ababa University. I would like to be an architect, but if I fail to, it is not a problem since I 
               would also be happy to become a construction manager. I love the fact that I learn in Addis Ababa University. Everyone and 
               everything here are attractive. Be it the staff, the instructors, the students, or the local people, they all make you happy. 
               Though the education is a little bit difficult, I have so far coped with it by studying so hard.
