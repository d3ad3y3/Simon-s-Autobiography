               I am Simon Girma. I was born on July 8 2000 in the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debre_Berhan">Debre Birhan</a> , which is located 120 kilo meters away from the capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa">Addis Ababa</a> .
                I was also raised in Debre Birhan where I spent an unforgettable childhood. Though I have lost all memory of the first two and three 
                years of my life, I remember everything after that. Like any Ethiopian kid, I grew up playing with other kids in my village. Football and hide and seek were 
                the games we played the most. When I turned four, I started learning kindergarten in a Catholic school. After learning there for two years, I started going to 
                another school called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Millennium-Academy-Shewa-Debre-Birhan-103528541327389/">Millennium Academy </a> where I completed the rest of my elementary and high school educations upto grade 12.
